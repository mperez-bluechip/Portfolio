# Portfolio site generated by Laravel's PHP Framework

Welcome to my portfolio site currently under construction. This site is run by Laravel together with Gulp, SASS, and Bootstrap to show how templating would integrate with forms and images. Dependencies will be added in order to provide both development and production versions, combining javascript files, livereload, and watch capabilities in order to update future changes in the docs.

Migrations through artisan CLI commands, I established database Schema structure along with user registration and log in.
